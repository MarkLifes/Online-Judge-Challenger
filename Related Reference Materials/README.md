Stanford Course: Algorithm
----------
Algorithms are the heart of computer science, and the subject has countless practical applications as well as intellectual depth. This course is an introduction to algorithms for learners with at least a little programming experience.

The specialization is rigorous but emphasizes the big picture and conceptual understanding over low-level implementation and mathematical details.Here is the [LINK](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) to the content on coursera.

Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++
----------
What I read is the Chinese version of this book (*数据结构与算法分析：C++语言描述*). Sorry that I do not have the original version. 

For the Chinese version, please proceed to my [Book Collection](https://github.com/peterljq/Data-Structure-C-Language-Exercises/tree/master/Related%20Book%20Collection) to download the pdf.
